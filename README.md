# Pancreatic_Cancer_Detection
Developed a Flask-based AI system for pancreatic cancer detection using pretrained VGG16 with Grad-CAM. Users can upload medical images for classification whether the scanning image cantain cancer or not, with heatmaps highlighting critical areas for interpretability. Integrated login/signup authentication for secure access and provided real-time inference with precautionary measures for healthcare awareness.
We have taken dataset from this website :  https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/wm8j6j2mph/1

Features
✅ Deep Learning-Based Detection using VGG16
✅ Explainability with Grad-CAM heatmaps
✅ User Authentication (Login & Signup)
✅ Real-Time Image Processing & Inference
✅ Precautionary Measures & Recommendations

Tech Stack 
Backend: Flask

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Machine Learning: TensorFlow, Keras (Pretrained VGG16)

Explainability: Grad-CAM

Database: SQLite (for user authentication)
Usage
Sign up / Log in to access the system.

Upload a medical image (CT scan or MRI).

The system classifies the image as cancerous or non-cancerous.

A Grad-CAM heatmap highlights critical regions in the image.

The system provides precautionary measures based on the prediction.Screenshots
